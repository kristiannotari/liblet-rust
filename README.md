# liblet-rust

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kristiannotari/liblet-rust.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kristiannotari/liblet-rust)

Porting project for the [liblet library](https://github.com/let-unimi/liblet) of the University of Milan course "Linguaggi e Traduttori" (Languages and Translators) in Rust.

This is a learning project, used to better comprehend both the course topics and the rust programming language.

A general and _maybe_ updated roadmap/to-do list is available in this repo project.

> Note that this project specifically aims to reproduce most of the features prioritizing CF grammars. So, for first versions of ported features, support for type 0 and 1 grammars could be missing.
