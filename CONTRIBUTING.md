# Contributing

Any contributions are greatly appreciated.

The concept of this library started as a learning project for me since I'm currently studying both the area
we're touching with `liblet-rust`:
- rust
- formal languages and grammars, translators, interpreters and compilers

The goal is to realize a rust library which can help to structure and manipulate formal languages objects, like
`grammar`s and `derivation`s, and easily display them in order to get a grasp of the theoretical aspects of the subject.
You can delve more about the goals in the original [liblet]() library for python (which, obviously, is better at quickly writing
down and visualize data than rust).

If you want to contribute or point me out errors or mistakes, please do so by opening new issues following issues templates,
creating pull requests or contacting me directly (you can find my email inside my GitHub profile).

Moreover, a long-term goal here is to also achieve some more complex algorithms implementations and some useful basics which
folks can hopefully use in the future to create other rust projects based on them. So, if you have any considerations and plan
for this to happen, please tell me about it using one of the ways described above.

Thanks for contributing!
